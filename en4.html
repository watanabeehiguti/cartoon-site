        <h1>4. Toonix and Check it!</h1>

        <p>Toonix was the successor to Noods in Latin America, officially launched in Brazil in August 2010. The concept was the same: 3D figurines of the same model with the physical characteristics of Cartoon Network characters. However, Toonix also ended up gaining their own line of characters; that is, there were the "original" Toonix, with their own characteristics, and the Toonix of Cartoon Network characters. They had the power to absorb the color of everything they touched, and CN used this to create several mini-clips at the time to promote the channel's new look. They also became the avatars of the Cartoon Network's Latin American website, customizable to users' wishes. Another interesting fact is that Toonix were even a prize in McDonald's Happy Meals in Brazil, and also had some other toy and merchandise lines released. This era was short-lived, lasting only until September 2012, but Toonix were very influential in the childhood of Brazilian children at the time.</p>

        <p>Soon after came the Check It! era, which happened globally. Its main aesthetic change was a much more colorful visual style than previous eras. The predominant colors were those of the most famous characters of the time, along with cyan, yellow, and magenta—the primary colors. In Asia and Australia, the era was called It's a Fun Thing, and the general concept was to bring new animations that would appeal to both younger and older audiences, rather than having separate blocks for each. Therefore, the cartoons of this era had a more childlike style, were very colorful, but possessed ambiguous content that could be enjoyed by children or interpreted more deeply by older viewers. An example is the animation Over the Garden Wall, highly acclaimed for being dark "in just the right measure." This era also focused heavily on humor and jokes, playing with the possibility of a work being both funny and sensitive at the same time. It officially ended in 2016 and was the last era of Cartoon Network to still use 3D animation for the mini-clips of its visual identity.</p>

        <p>It was meant to be a completely new Cartoon Network, and during its run (2011-2016) there were minor design changes, but nothing too significant. The programming still featured older cartoons, but invested in the production of many new cartoons that were quite successful. According to popular opinion, this was Cartoon Network's last peak era, where the cartoons had quality and high viewership. It was divided into four phases: </p>
        
        <ul class="lista-checkit">
    <li>
        <strong>Check It 1.0:</strong> In the first version of the new brand, 
        the predominance of the old black and white logo was still present, 
        but with the colorful touch of cyan, yellow, and magenta. 
        The bumpers (mini-clips) were simpler, only featuring the CN logo.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Check It 2.0:</strong> It debuted back in 2011, with the alternative name of
        YEEEAUHHHH!. It's very similar to what was done with the Blocks, and was used almost simultaneously with version 1.0,
        the biggest difference were in the bumpers.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Check It 3.0:</strong> It premiered in 2013 and updated the entire channel's language,
        despite maintaining the same visual identity. The animations became more colorful and featured various styles.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Check It 4.0:</strong> This marked a shift in focus for Cartoon Network towards a younger 
        audience, with more child-friendly animations and new remakes like Ben 10, The Powerpuff Girls, 
        and Teen Titans Go!
    </li>
</ul>
        <p>The videos below show the main bumpers from all phases of the Check it! era.</p>
        <p><strong>Remarkable cartoons at the time: Adventure Time, Regular Show, The Amazing World of Gumball, Uncle Grandpa, Steven Universe</strong></p>
