         <h1>Cartoon Network? Who's that?</h1>
         <p>Cartoon Network (CN, for short) is an American cable television network owned by Warner Bros. Global Kids, Young Adults and Classics, a division of Warner Bros. Entertainment. It was founded in 1992, and it targets a young audience, especially children aged 6 to 14. It was the first channel entirely focused on animation and had a major influence on the popularization of cartoons worldwide. Throughout the channel's various phases, it featured diverse cartoon programming, allowing children to experience other cultures through animations with creators, production, and characters from other origins.</p>
         <p>Since the channel has been operating for over 30 years, several generations of children and teenagers have been shaped by the cartoons that have been/are broadcast. The goal of this website is to define each cartoon generation by its most striking characteristics, highlight some of the most popular cartoons, contextualize each generation, and point out the peculiarities of each one depending on the country, and how each generation operated in different parts of the world.</p>
