         <h1>5. Dimensional, Redraw Your World and Pastel</h1>
         <img src="dimensional.jpg" alt="A white background montage with two images placed side-by-side; the one on the right represents the Dimensional era, and the one on the left represents Redraw your world." class="img-dimensional">
         <p>The Dimensional brand began in 2016 and officially ended in 2021. Initially, it was very similar to the last version of Check It!, only innovating in the bumpers, which now adopted very different styles (stop-motion animations mixed with 2D and 3D), but the color scheme was the same. This is a somewhat gray period, because the separation between Dimensional and Check It! is not well defined, mainly because it was the least unified of all the brand changes; each country adopted it at a different time. Most channels in Eastern and Western Europe, the Middle East, and Africa adopted the Dimensional brand between September and December 2016, Italy in November, and the Turkish channel in January 2017, along with Latin America.</p>
         <p>In the Philippines, bumpers and key elements from this era began to be used in February 2017, but the Philippine channel only officially became Dimensional in October, along with other Asian channels (except Japan, which joined in April). In Great Britain and Ireland, the channel became known as Dimensional in July and, unlike other European channels, they had customized bumpers to announce their programming. In Portugal, the change occurred in March, and in France/Switzerland, in September with customized bumpers.</p>
         <img src="pastel.jpg" alt="A montage on a white background with a slightly desaturated green image featuring the Cartoon Network logo. The characters present, from left to right, are Grizzly, Panda, and Polar Bear from We Baby Bears, Apple and Onion, Craig from Craig of the Creek, and Suzie from Summer Camp Island." class="img-pastel">
         <p>The identity of Dimensional gradually changed, shifting towards using the characters' real-life color palette more and moving away from the overwhelming focus on primary colors, which ended in 2021. The era that followed was Redraw Your World, which still maintained the primary color scheme, but on a smaller scale. It lasted only until 2022, when it was replaced by the current Pastel brand. As the name suggests, the new visual identity focuses on more pastel and less vibrant colors. This era gained new vignettes and programming announcements, but the programming itself declined in both quantity and quality due to the growth of streaming services. Most of Cartoon Network's content in Brazil is available on HBO Max, and in other countries it's distributed through existing streaming services like Disney+, Netflix, Prime Video, etc. With the drop in viewership, the channel has now stopped investing in the creation of original cartoons and is only re-airing old ones. Even so, before this happened, some cartoons were released during this period and in Redraw Your World.</p>
         <p><strong> Those are: Apple and Onion,Craig of the Creek, Summer Camp Island, Jessica's Little Big World and We baby Bears.</strong></p>
