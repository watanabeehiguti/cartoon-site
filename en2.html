         <h1>2. Powerhouse and Blocks</h1>
         <img src="powerhouse.jpg" alt="A white background montage with a blue image in the center, the Cartoon Network logo in black and white checkerboard, and some characters around it. On the right side, from top to bottom, are the characters Samurai Jack, Mac and Blu from Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, and Juniper Lee. In the center is the Kids Next Door. On the left side, from top to bottom, are the characters Billy and Mandy, Naruto, and Ed, Edd n Eddy." class="img-powerhouse">
         <p>The "Powerhouse" era succeeded the checkerboard era and marked the beginning of a new generation for cartoons. It was named after the song "Powerhouse" by Raymond Scott, which was the theme song for the short clips broadcast at the time. Officially, in the US, it began in March 1998 and ended in June 2004. However, in other countries, it had a different broadcast period. In Europe, for example, the era began in 1999 and ended in 2002, while in Asia and Australia it lasted from 1999 to 2005, and in Latin America, it lasted from April 1998 to December 2004.</p>
         <p>In this era, Cartoon Network wanted to explore what made cartoons so caricatured. They respected the "classic" style of creating cartoons and characters, but innovated in other areas, for example, keeping the background monochromatic and indicating changes such as the time of day or the intention of a certain scene with a change of color.
         <p>The Powerhouse logo became Cartoon Network's visual identity in the US, which made different countries to adapt the content of the animations and vignettes to better fit their culture. It was also during this time that the channel began to give more prominence to original animations; in fact, most cartoons from other studios, such as Hanna-Barbera, migrated to the Boomerang channel.</p>
         <p>The Blocks, or Casillas in Spain, only existed in Europe, succeeding Powerhouse from 2002 to 2006. The theme was slightly different and would be used again by other countries later. They were blocks featuring characters from Hanna-Barbera, MGM, and Warner Bros. cartoons that presented mini-clips, called bumpers.</p>
         <p>It's also worth noting that it was during this period (Powerhouse) that the Toonami programming block began airing in Brazil. This block was dedicated solely to anime and greatly popularized Japanese animation in the West, marking the childhood of many people with Naruto, One Piece, and Saint Seiya (Knights of the Zodiac).</p>
         <p><strong>Remarkable cartoons at the time: The Powerpuff Girls, Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, Samurai Jack, The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy, Codename: Kids Next Door, Star Wars: Clone Wars, and Ed, Edd n Eddy.</strong></p>
