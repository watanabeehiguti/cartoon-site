         <h1>3. CN City and Noods</h1>
         <img src="cn city.jpg" alt="A white background montage featuring the characters Billy and Mandy, Ed from Edd n Eddy, Blossom from The Powerpuff Girls, Mac and Blu from Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, Bubbles from The Powerpuff Girls, Lazlo and Chief from Codename: Kids Next Door in different positions on a movie theater staircase." class="img-cncity">
         <p>The City era officially began in June 2004, replacing Powerhouse, and ended in May 2007. It received this name because it focused on a more urban visual identity, showing the cartoon characters in a city setting in bumpers, or mini-promotional clips. Cartoon Network also began making shorts, with the same city setting concept, between each cartoon's programming, featuring character crossovers, which gave the channel an original and more fun feel.</p>
         <p>This was the first time Cartoon Network had undergone an identity overhaul of this magnitude, creating its own universe for its characters using 3D computer graphics, whereas the animations were previously in 2D. Despite the significant change, the concept fit very well with Cartoon Network's motto, which is to promote animated shows. Creating a realistic city that houses the channel's most famous cartoon characters and having the characters interact with each other was a very well-thought-out strategy to bring the cartoons closer to the viewer, as well as attracting more people to the channel.</p>
         <p>As for the schedule, initially it was the same as Powerhouse, and over time it adapted to the tastes of the new generation of viewers due to the end of the most influential animations of the previous era. In this new phase of animation, CN was inspired by the success of the Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends style to continue with its new list of cartoons. It was also during this time that the concern arose to keep the older audience entertained with the channel, so they began to broadcast animations that were a little less childish, with less comedic features and more "serious" themes, such as Generator Rex, Ben 10: Alien Force, and Titan Sym-Bionic.</p>
         <img src="noods.jpg" alt="Image on a white background featuring four 3D figures with oval heads, long necks, wide torsos, and short limbs. The figures have the likenesses of the characters Chowder, Echo from Ben 10, Flapjack, and Fred Fredburger from Billy & Mandy." class="img-noods">
         
        
         <p>CN City had several subdivisions that succeeded its visual identity, such as Summer 2007 and Fall, but there were no significant changes to the schedule or the conceptual line of the cartoons at the time; it was more of an aesthetic change to match the seasons. After that, in the US, the Noods era began, in which 3D figurines were created in a single mold adhering to the design of each of the Cartoon Network characters. This was done to emphasize that the Cartoon Network brand identity was, from that moment on, definitively inseparable from the cartoons and their characters. This era lasted until May 2010.</p>
         <p>The video below show the main bumpers of the CN City Era</p>
         <p><strong>Remarkable cartoons at the time: Ben 10, My Gym Partner is a Monkey, Camp Lazlo, The Life and Times of Juniper Lee, and Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi.</strong></p>
