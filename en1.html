         <h1>1. Checkerboard</h1>
         <img src="checkerboard.jpg" alt="A white background montage with a black and white checkerboard image with Cartoon Network written in the center. To the right, the characters Tom & Jerry are at the top and the Powerpuff Girls at the bottom. In the center below the logo are the Flintstones characters. To the left, at the top, are the characters Billy and Mandy, and at the bottom, the character Johnny Bravo." class="img-checkerboard">
         <p>This was the era that began Cartoon Network in 1992 and lasted until 1998. The idea for creating this first visual identity came from the intention to attract viewers to this channel, which until then was the only one to broadcast cartoons 24 hours a day. Because of this, the logo needed to be vibrant while also being legible, so they opted to use a black and white color scheme, like a chessboard (hence the name "checkerboard"). As these colors were considered outdated for cartoons at the time, they embellished this scheme with a more childish and "cartoonish" font.</p>
         <p>The most frequently broadcast cartoons were the classics from Hanna-Barbera, MGM, and Warner Bros. studios, but even then Cartoon Network was already producing and broadcasting its own original cartoons, which counted to four. During this period, several animation blocks were broadcast, for example, "What a Cartoon Show!", dedicated to shorts, and "Boomerang," dedicated to classic cartoons. Some shorts from "What a Cartoon Show" later received their own animated series, such as Johnny Bravo and The Powerpuff Girls, while "Boomerang" became its own channel in 2000.</p>
         <p>The videos below show, respectively, the bumpers (short clips) from the Powerhouse era and the Blocks era.</p>
         <p><strong>Remarkable cartoons at the time: Looney Tunes, Popeye, The Flintstones, The Jetsons, The Moxy Show (original CN), Dexter's Laboratory (original CN), Space Ghost Coast to Coast (original CN), and Cow and Chicken (original CN).</strong></p>
